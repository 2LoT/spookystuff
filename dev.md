If you have a new feature, improvement or bugfix, please keep an eye on the travis-CI report, try not breaking old tests and fix any test failure before merging into master. Also, it's much safer to add some unit tests to ensure that your user cases are working, otherwise it may risk of being overwritten by other committers. This is a early-stage open-source project, please respect your peer's opinion and contributions, and feel free to request or work on new feature and improvements.
