<h2>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In a nutshell, <strong>SpookyStuff</strong> scales up data collection by distributing web clients to many machines. Each of them receives a portion of heterogeneous tasks and run them independently. After that, their results can either be transformed and reused to dig deeper into the web by visiting more dynamic pages, or be exported into one of many data storage: including local HDD, HDFS, Amazon S3, or simply Memory block in JVM.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SpookyStuff</strong> is extremely lightweight by offloading most of the task scheduling &amp; data transformation work to Apache Spark. It doesn't depend on any file system (even HDFS is optional), backend database, or message queue, or any SOA. Your query speed is only bounded by your bandwidth and CPU power.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SpookyStuff</strong> use phantomjs/GhostDriver to access dynamic pages and mimic human interactions with them, but it doesn't render them - nor does it download any image embedded in them by default (unless you take a screenshot), which makes it still considerably faster even on a single machine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SpookyStuff</strong>'s query language is an extension of Spark API, there is no problem in mixing it with other Spark-based environments, notably SparkSQL and MLlib.</p></li>

It came with preloaded Windows 8 OS and they refuse to load the OS without charging me for it. The laptop is under warranty. Best was that the reason given for the crash by the service engineer is 'Monsoons'. Never buy an HP machine. "
1/5 2013-09-04  "I can not believe how bad the service was. I wanted our company to resell HP products. I have been calling HP for weeks. Every time I call I feel like they push me to tears. When I first called the women didn't know English, she had no one else to speak to me. I called another number, an American answered, but he had no understanding of how to make a new contract but suggested he could transfer me. He did and I got a live person, until he put me on hold and the call was disconnected. I called the number on the HP partners website and they said that they are a whole other company that works for HP and don't have any idea of what to do or who to call. This continued on. It was so stressful. I mean I am so sad and stressed. I may be better off finding another company to work with. I have wasted many valuable days of work and so has my assistant. It is time consuming and costly dealing with them."
1/5 2013-09-03  "I bought a HP CM-1015 multi-function printer/scanner/copier several years ago. It worked fine when connected to a WindowsXP print server. When I upgraded the XP to Windows 7 (about three years ago), I could not find a driver for it, so I waited, waited, and waited more. Today is September 3, 2013, I installed the newest posted driver that I downloaded from the HP’s website, and it still does not work: It only prints black-and-white, not color. I am not even asking to have all the functions of the machine to work, just the printer part, is this too much for HP? I am very disappointed at the HP product and its service. I bought the HP brand because I thought I would get a great product with great service. What I got is the opposite. Now, I am looking at this almost new machine (it has not been used much in the past years) and wondering: Should I get rid of it ($500+ when purchased) and get another brand? It is really a waste of money and time."

<h2>
<a id="performance" class="anchor" href="#performance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Performance</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the above University Logo example test run, each single r3.large instance (2 threads, 15g memory) achieved 410k/s download speed in average with 45% CPU usage. Thus, the entire 4-node, 8-thread cluster is able to finish the job in 13 minutes by downloading 1279M of data, including 1271M by browsers (no surprise, GoogleImage shows a hell lot of images on page 1!) and 7.7M by direct HTTP GET.</p>

<ul>
<li>Query speed can be further improved by enabling over-provisioning of executors per thread (since web agents are idle while waiting for responses). For example, allowing 4 executors to be run on each r3.large node can double CPU usage to ~90%, thus potentially doubling your query speed to 820k/s. However, this tuning will be ineffective if network bandwidth has been reached.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We haven't tested but many others' Spark test run that involves HTTP client (e.g. querying a distributed Solr/ElasticSearch service) and heterogeneous data processing has achieved near-linear scalability under 150 nodes (theoretically, a speedup of x900 comparing to conventional single-browser scrapping! assuming you are just using r3.large instance). Massive Spark clusters (the largest in history being 1000 nodes) has also been experimented in some facilities but their performances are still unknown.</p></li>
<li><p>Using Wget (equivalent to simple HTTP GET) instead of Visit for static/non-interactive pages in your Action Plan can save you a lot of time and network throughput in query as it won't start the browser and download any resources for the page.</p></li>
<li><p>Further optimization options may include switching to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kryo/">Kryo serializer</a> (to replace Java serializer) and <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html">YARN (Hadoop 2 component)</a> (to replace Spark Standalone Master), however these options are not tested yet. So we encourage you to test these options and post any performance issue/bug you encountered, but not using them in production.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>Current implementation only supports Language INtegrated Query (LINQ), APIs are not finalized and may change anytime in the future. Support for SQL is on the roadmap but may be abandoned in favour of simplicity.</p>

<p>Each query is a combination of 3 parts: Context, Action Plan and Extraction.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong> represents input and output data of a scraping job in key-value format. They are always created as strings or key-value pairs, being carried by other entities as metadata through a query's lifespan.</p>

<p>Creating of <strong>Context</strong> can use any Spark parallelization or transformation (though this is rarely used), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>- sc.parallelize("Metallica","Megadeth","Slayer","Anthrax")

- sc.parallelize(Map("first name"-&gt;"Taylor","last name"=&gt;"Swift"), Map("first name"-&gt;"Avril","last name"-&gt;"Lavigne"))

- sc.parallelize("Taylor\tSwift", "Avril\tLavigne").csvToMap("first name\tlast name", "\t")

- sc.fromTextFile("products.txt")

- noInput(this creates a query entry point with no context)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Action Plan</strong> always has the following format:</p>

<pre><code>(**Context** +&gt; Action1 +&gt; Action2 +&gt; ... +&gt; ActionN !)
</code></pre>

<p>These are the same actions a human would do to access the data page, their order of execution is identical to that they are defined.</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong> have 3 types:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Export</em>: Export a page from a browser or client, the page an be any web resource including HTML/XML file, image, PDF file or JSON string.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Interactive</em>: Interact with the browser (e.g. click a button or type into a search box) to reach the data page, all interactive executed before a page will be logged into that page's backtrace.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Container</em>: Only for complex workflow control, each defines a nested/non-linear subroutine that may or may not be executed once or multiple times depending on situations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Many Actions supports <strong>Context Interpolation</strong>: you can embed context reference in their constructor by inserting context's keys enclosed by <code>#{}</code>, which will be automatically replaced with values they map to in runtime. This is used almost exclusively in typing into a textbox.</p>

<p>For more information on Actions and Action Plan usage, please refer to the scaladoc of ClientAction.scala and ActionPlanRDDFunction.scala respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Extraction</strong> defines a transformation from Pages (including immediate pages from Action Plans and their link connections -- see <em>join/left-join</em>) to relational data output. This is often the goal and last step of data collection, but not always -- there is no constraint on their relative order, you can reuse extraction results as context to get more data on a different site, or feed into another data flow implemented by other components of Apache Spark (Of course, only if you know them).</p>

<p>Functions in <strong>Extraction</strong> have four types:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>extract</em>: Extract data from Pages by using data's enclosing elements' HTML/XML/JSON selector(s) and attribute(s) as anchor points.</p></li>
<li><p><em>save/dump</em>: Save all pages into a file system (HDD/S3/HDFS).</p></li>
<li><p><em>select</em>: Extract data from Pages and insert them into the pages' respective context as metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><em>join</em>: This is similar to the notion of join in relational databases, except that links between pages are used as foreign keys between tables. (Technical not just links, but anything that infers a connection between web resources, including frames, iframes, sources and redirection).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on Extraction syntax, please refer to the scaladoc of Page.scala and PageRDDFunction.scala.</p>

<h3>
<a id="-to-local-computersingle-node" class="anchor" href="#-to-local-computersingle-node" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>... to Local Computer/Single Node</h3>

<ol>

<li> Install Apache Spark 1.1.1 from [<a href="http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html">http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html</a>]
(Optional, highly recommended otherwise you have to set it everytime before running the shell or application i.e. add path to .bash_profile file) Edit your startup script to point the environment variable of Spark to your Spark installation directory: <br>
<code>export SPARK_HOME=<em>{PATH_TO_SPARK_FOLDER}</em></code>
</li>

<li> (Optional if no Java installed and set environment before) Install Java. On Ubuntu, use apt-get to install Java by <code>sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk</code>
and add java path as follow <br>
<code>export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64</code>
</li>

<li> Install PhantomJS 1.9.8 from [<a href="http://phantomjs.org/download.html">http://phantomjs.org/download.html</a>]
<ul>
<li> For zip file, the binary <code>bin/phantomjs</code> is ready to use. Recommended to install to '/usr/lib/phantomjs', otherwise please change <em>phantomJSRootPath</em> in <em>org.tribbloid.spookystuff.Const.scala</em> to point to your PhantomJS directory and recompile. Then add path for phantomjs i.e. <code>export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/lib</code></li>
<li> Also provided by Ubuntu official repository (so you can apt-get it) but current binary is severely obsolete (1.9.0), use of this binary is NOT recommended and may cause unpredictable error.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
  Git clone Spooky Stuff repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/tribbloid/spookystuff</code>
</li>
<li> Run <code>./mvn-install.sh</code> to setup Spooky Stuff which contains bash script as follows<br>
<code>MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m" mvn package -DskipTests=true</code>
<ul>
increasing jvm heapspace size for Apache Maven is mandatory as 2 modules (example and shell) will generate uber jars. Also make sure that Maven is installed. On Ubuntu, we can install Maven by <code>sudo apt-get install maven</code> (version >=3.0.0)
</ul>
</li>

<li>That's it! Now you have 3 options to use it:
<ul>
  <li>(easiest) launch spooky-shell and improvise your query: <code>bin/spooky-shell.sh</code> </li>
  <li>give any example a test run: bin/submit-example.sh <em>name of the example</em></li>
  <li>write your own application by importing spooky-core into your dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>

<h3>
<a id="-to-clusteramazon-ec2" class="anchor" href="#-to-clusteramazon-ec2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>... to Cluster/Amazon EC2</h3>

<ol>
<li>Setup a cluster and assure mutual connectivity</li>
<li>Install Ubuntu 12+ on all nodes.

<ul>
<li>scripts to autodeploy on other Spark-compatible OS is currently NOT under active development. Please vote on the issue tracker if you demand it.</li>
<li>the easiest way to set it up is on Amazon EC2, AMI with pre-installed environment and autoscaling ability will be made public shortly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install Ansible on your client and make sure you can ssh into all your nodes with a valid private key (id_rsa).</li>
<li>Edit files in ops/ansible/inventories.template to include ip/dns of your master node and all worker nodes. Change the directory name to /ops/ansible/inventories</li>
<li>cd into ops/ansible and:

<ul>
<li>deploy master: ./ansible-playbook deploy-master.yml -i ./inventories --private-key=<em>yor private key (id_rsa)</em>
</li>
<li>deploy workers: .ansible-ploybook deploy-worker.yml -i ./inventories --private-key=<em>yor private key (id_rsa)</em>
</li>
<li>this will install oracle-java7 and do step 1,2,3, automatically on all nodes. You can do it manually but that's a lot of work!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do step 4,5 on master node and run any of the 3 options

<ul>
<li>you can download and run it on any node in the same subnet of the cluster, but expect heavy traffic between your client node and master node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="alternatively-" class="anchor" href="#alternatively-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>alternatively ...</h3>

<p>you can use scripts in $SPARK_HOME/ec2 to setup a Spark cluster with transient HDFS support. But this has 2 problems:
    - Autoscaling is currently not supported.
    - Spark installation directory is hardcoded to '/root/spark', if your client has a different directory it may cause some compatibility issue.</p>
